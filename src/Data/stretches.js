  {
    title: 'Static hip flexor stretch',
    reps: '30-60sec each side',
    desc: 'Many of us, particularly deskbound workers, have tight hip flexors from sitting down all day. If not addressed, this can lead to lower-back injury while weight training. For this stretch, get on one knee with the other foot in front. Push forwards to stretch your hip, keeping your core tight and squeezing your opposing glutes as you do so.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Deep lunge with hip circles',
    reps: '5 circles each leg',
    desc: 'This helps to start mobilising the hips and increasing synovial fluid at the joints, which reduces friction. While holding a deep lunge position with your hands on the floor in front, start circling the front knee to stretch and mobilise the hip.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Deep lunge hold with thoracic rotation',
    reps: '5 reaches each side',
    desc: 'In a deep lunge position, reach to the floor with one elbow, then rotate your torso and reach to the ceiling with the same arm. This mobilises the spine and helps prepare for rotational movements.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Downward dog walk-out',
    reps: '5',
    desc: 'From a press-up position walk your hands backwards towards your feet, pushing your hips upwards and keeping your legs as straight as possible to feel the stretch in your hamstrings and calves – in yoga this is known as the downward dog position. Then walk your hands back to the press-up position and repeat.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Band shoulder dislocate',
    reps: '10',
    desc: 'Grasp a resistance band and pull it apart so your arms are straight out to the sides. Keeping the band stretched and your arms straight, move the band in a large arc over the top of your head and onto the back of your shoulders, keeping your torso upright throughout. This helps improve the range of movement in your shoulders and increases synovial fluid at the shoulder joint in preparation for upper-body exercises.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Lunge with overhead reach',
    reps: '20',
    desc: 'You’re almost finished warming up – you just want to make sure the heart rate is elevated and all your joints are warm and ready for action. Lunges with overhead reaches will get the heart working and prep almost every joint in your body for movement. Step into a lunge and reach above your head with both arms. Alternate legs.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Exercise Specific Warm-Ups',
    reps: 'n/a',
    desc: 'After this warm-up, it’s advisable to do one or two warm-up sets of every exercise you’re going to do in the weights room. This not only properly prepares the specific joints, but also gives your body time to learn that movement as well as priming your nervous system.'
